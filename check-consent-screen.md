# OAuth Consent Screen Check

Since your OAuth client is correctly configured as "Web application", the issue is likely the **OAuth consent screen status**.

## 🔍 Check OAuth Consent Screen Status:

1. **Go to:** https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent
2. **Look for "Publishing status":**

### If Status is "Testing":
- ❌ **Problem:** Apps in testing mode have restricted access
- ✅ **Solution:** Either:
  - Click "PUBLISH APP" to make it public, OR
  - Add `ethan.ratnowsky@gmail.com` as a test user

### If Status is "Needs Verification":
- ❌ **Problem:** Google requires verification for certain scopes
- ✅ **Solution:** For development, you can still use it but need to add test users

### If Status is "Published":
- ✅ **Good:** Should work for any Google account

## 🎯 Quick Fix for Testing:

**Option 1: Add Test User (Fastest)**
1. In OAuth consent screen settings
2. Go to "Test users" section  
3. Click "ADD USERS"
4. Add: `ethan.ratnowsky@gmail.com`
5. Save

**Option 2: Publish App (For production)**
1. Click "PUBLISH APP" 
2. Confirm the publication
3. Wait 5-10 minutes

## 🧪 Test After Changes:
Once you've updated the consent screen, try the OAuth flow again.
